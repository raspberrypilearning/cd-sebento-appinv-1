## What next?

Now you know how to build this quiz, what else can you do with this code? On this card, I'm going to give you a few ideas but you can always come up with something cooler.

+ What about an interactive story? You can use the same blocks you use to move from one screen to the next to move around screens based on users' decisions. You can create a story where, for example, you can decide to turn left or right at a fork in the road. If you map it out on paper first, you can create a complex branching story with loads of different characters, secrets, and endings!

+ You can build an app that gives information on different screens, connected with buttons, about anything you're interested in! You can try adding an **Image** component to the screen and uploading pictures too. I could build another dog-themed app, with pictures and information about different breeds!
