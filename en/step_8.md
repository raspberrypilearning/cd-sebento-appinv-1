## What next?

Now you know how to build this quiz, what else can you do with this code? On this card, I'm going to give you a few ideas but you can always come up with something cooler.

+ What about an interactive story that helps people understand what it's like to live with a particular condition? You can use the same blocks you use to move from one screen to the next to move around screens based on users' decisions. You can create a story where, for example, you can decide to go into one room or another, or choose from a number of options what to say to a person you meet. If you map it out on paper first, you can create a complex branching story with loads of different characters, secrets, and endings!

+ You can build an app that gives information on different screens, connected with buttons, about anything you're interested in! You can try adding an **Image** component to the screen and uploading pictures too. I could build an app about global food production, with pictures and information about what each country produces, and where the foods are exported to.
